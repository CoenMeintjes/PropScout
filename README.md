# PropScout

The PropScout app is a simple to use app created for property investors to help them identify promising markets as well as simpligy the process of property deal analysis.

## Immediate Issues

In terms of the market analysis - Both stats (statssa and adrian frith) sites are blocking the app from webscraping so not sure how to deal with that.

property24 is allowing the spider to accesss the site so maybe focus on the email trigger feature.
